# README - compile and run pgModeler using a Virtualbox VM

As described in it's repo, https://github.com/pgmodeler/pgmodeler :

«An open-source, multiplatform database modeler for PostgreSQL. This project aims to be a reference database design tool when it comes to FOSS in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. Its feature-rich interface allows quick data modeling and fast code deployment on a server. It also supports reverse engineering by creating a visual representation of existing databases. Besides, pgModeler can also generate SQL scripts to sync a model and a database through the process called diff. This tool is not about modeling only, it also counts with a minimalist but functional database server administration module that allows the execution of any sort of SQL commands, and provides database browsing and data handling in a simple and intuitive UI.»

You can use pgModeler [from a Virtualbox virtual machine](Readme-virtualbox.md)

Or you can use it [from a Docker container](README-docker.md).
